# Project Description:
This Android application provides a fair, accessible, and user-friendly way for people to sign up for high-demand community centre events. Instead of requiring users to constantly refresh a webpage or race to be first, the system uses a lottery-based waiting list. Entrants can join an event’s pool of interested participants, and organizers can randomly draw selected attendees once the registration window closes. The goal is to ensure fair access, especially for individuals with work schedules, disabilities, or other constraints that make first-come-first-served systems inaccessible.

# Key Features:
### Lottery-Based Pooling System:
Organizers can create events and allow entrants to join a waiting list. After a set time window, the organizer can perform a random draw of selected participants. Declined or canceled spots automatically trigger a redraw to fill available slots.

### QR Code Scanning
Entrants can scan event QR codes to instantly view event details and join the waiting list with a single action.

### Firebase Integration
Securely store and manage events, entrants, selected participants, and check-in statuses. Real-time updates ensure organizers and entrants always see current information.

### Multi-User Roles
The system distinguishes between:
- Entrants – join events and view results
- Organizers – create events, run lotteries, manage attendance
- Admin – oversee all system operations
  
Each role has unique permissions and access levels.

### Image Upload
Organizers can upload event posters or promotional images directly from their device, improving event clarity and engagement.

### Geolocation Verification (Optional)
Event organizers can optionally require location verification when entrants join a waiting list, helping ensure fair and region-appropriate participation.
